# Face-Detection
This project demonstrates a simple real-time face detection system using the Haar Cascade classifier in OpenCV. 
It captures video from the webcam, detects faces in each frame, draws bounding boxes around them, and displays useful metrics like FPS (Frames Per Second) and face count.
